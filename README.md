What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored inside the database and executed as a single unit. Instead of writing the same SQL logic repeatedly, we can save it once as a stored procedure and call it whenever required.

In simple terms, a stored procedure works like a reusable program for the database.

Why Stored Procedures are Used
*Stored procedures are used for several important reasons:
*Reusability: Write SQL logic once and reuse it multiple times.
*Better Performance: Stored procedures are precompiled, which helps queries run faster.
*Security: Users can execute procedures without having direct access to database tables.
*Maintainability: Business logic stays inside the database, making it easier to manage and update.
*Reduced Network Traffic: Multiple SQL statements can be executed with a single procedure call.
